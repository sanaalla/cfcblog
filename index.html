            <h3>1. Lev Manovich's 144 Hours in Kyiv</h3>
        
            

                  <!-- Preview Image -->
         <div><a href="http://www.the-everyday.net"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src='img/lev.jpg' width="560" height="50" ></a></div> 
                
                   <hr>
            <p>
         WHAT: Manovich’s project analyzes and visualizes Instagram posts from Ukraine during the moment of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution.
</p>

   
            
         <p> 
             WHY: This project explores the question: what can visual social media tell about the experiences of people during a social upheaval? It also investigates how exceptional events can coexist with everyday activities, and how the ordinary and extraordinary are connected visually. 
       
             
</p>

            <p>
            HOW: Using Instagram public API, Manovich and his team collected publicly available Instagram photos located from Kyiv during the span of the two months in February 2014 taht marked the Ukrainian revolution, Maidan. An analysis of these images was possible using open source and custom software tools to discover the upload dates and times, geolocations, and tags. 
</p>
            <p>SO WHAT: The importance of this project lies in the fact that it uses such an intimate and personal sharing of content to tell a story about a big event that news outlets and headlines would generalize. In this sense, there is more of a personal, real approach in this project. 
</p>

            
            
                        <h3>2. JeongHo Park’s Asteroid Sonification </h3>
 <div><a href="https://vimeo.com/131640439"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src='img/asteroid.jpg' width="560" height="50" ></a></div> 
          <hr>

      <p>
         WHAT: Essentially, JeongHo Park’s project is a data sonification of asteroids that is interactive through a digital interface that additionally visualizes the asteroids as well. Each asteroid sound is triggered when it enters into the playable zone. 
</p>

   
            
         <p> 
             WHY: This is a data sonification, which is an unorthodox but fascinating approach to understanding and interpreting information which is largely translated visually. 
       
             
</p>

            <p>
            HOW: Park draws on the Asteroid Database and Mining Rankings API for the data, and combines that with a spectrum sound generator to create the sound.

</p>
            <p>SO WHAT: His work is particularly meaningful because it shows the effectiveness of certain mediums over others when trying to present specific aspects of the data; in this case, Park’s asteroid sonification work is ideal for showing changes over time and recognizing patterns.
</p>
            
            
            
            
                        <h3>3. Mudit Ganguly's Phonopticon: The Age of Mobile Surveillance</h3>

          <hr>

      <p>
         WHAT: This thesis project for the Digital Futures Masters is a design research project analyzing and creating something dubbed the Phonopticon, an immersive installation informing the audience about privacy breaches in mobile applications.
</p>

   
            
         <p> 
             WHY: To spread awareness on the amount of information and data gathered by the applications on our smartphones. 
       
             
</p>

            <p>
            HOW: The thesis research uses Ken Wilber’s All Quadrant All Level as a guiding theoretical framework. Additionally, a study of six participants investigated how people use and understand the privacy concerns in the applications on their phones. Finally, the thesis project includes research through design and Barry Boehm’s Spiral Model of Software Development to create a physical installation that serves as a data visualization that informs users about the extent of privacy breaches on their phones. 

</p>
            <p>SO WHAT: Tt’s important to reevaluate the function and presence of smartphones in our individual lives, as they may be collecting more personal information than people are aware of.
