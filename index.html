            <p>
I think that my research interest has definitely evolved and become more focused due to the intense prototyping and making process that we went through in the first week of this prototyping course. Having to make an initial prototype challenged me in thinking less about the conceptual, writing-focused aspects of the thesis to actually considering how I would test the research questions I had formulated early on. In the beginning, I was interested in conducting scientific experiments on the retention of information depending on the form of medium in which participants had been presented the information in. However, when iterating the first version of what that experiment could look like, I found that I was less interested in the rigorous methodological framework this type of project would require and wanted to take a more focused approach to this thesis. 
</p>

   <p>by the way, here is the link to the user testing video compilation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSiOIob6bCo">VIDEO</a></p>

            <p>
Equally, the feedback I got from many of my peers (in post-it exercises and in-person conversation) was the need to figure out the message in question (if indeed my thesis is centered somewhat around medium is the message). This really made me think of the content itself, and exactly what I am visualizing. Keeping within the initial thought of using multiple mediums to convey aspects of the same dataset, or message, Feng (during our group session at one of the intensive CFC days) suggested to look at what personal data I can use. She specifically suggested looking at my own genetic data; however, after looking into this option I realized that genetics is still a new field and accessing your own genetic data is not actually as straightforward as I had hoped. Nevertheless, I was still intrigued by the idea of representation of a person through data, and then realized that it might make sense to use the data I’ve created on my own, digitally, throughout the years. Facebook turned out to have a vast amount of data collected on me (4 gigs worth=10 years of data collection!) that I was able to download as a bunch of folders of JSON. Honestly, this is looking like the most viable option for me to begin prototyping some visualizations/data representations of.

It really helps, I think, to have a clearer sense of the actual information I’m going to use, as it becomes a lot more digestible in my mind and also makes it feel more related to the design research methodology that I was hoping to use in this process. I met with Adam Tindale just to talk over the development of my thesis ideas and he brought up a really good point on WHY the development of the actual prototype/design product is important to the core of the thesis; why is this an MDes, vs. an MA? and I think that’s a really good question and something that would be worth keeping in mind for me.

Also, here is a photo of my actions and the eventual “value” that I hope users will engage with in my prototype:

                           <h3>Original "what/why/how/so what"</h3>
<p>
            


1.	What<br>
My thesis interest lies in exploring the question: what becomes of meaning when it is displayed in different mediums? Is information interpreted equally across all platforms? This research is situated in the context of ideas expressed by Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman, and includes a process of creation and experimentation. Additionally, in my research I would like to address the significance of personal identity and bias and the influence they have on the interpretation of information. I’d like to explore how content transforms, is limited by, or expanded within the form of media it is presented by.

            </p>
            <p>
2.	Why<br>
With the rapid development and change to digital technology, the way that we receive and distribute content changes vastly from the print culture that preceded; and before print, the change was from an oral culture. I think that it is important to be conscious and critical of these changes, and to consider the ways that mediums in addition to print and web also may affect the perception of information. Because there is a hypothesis that the message is absorbed differently across different mediums, it suggests that depending on the mode that people are receiving their information, it may develop into varying levels of understanding. This threatens to widen a gap of perception that already may exist, since people are already receiving and understanding content differently based on their own personal bias, in addition to the way in which that content had been accessed.
            </p>
            <p>
3.	How<br>
I hope to prototype the experimental phase of my research for user testing. This would involve the reformatting of an existing data visualization into other mediums, such as web, mobile, sound and possibly haptics; therefore, for the scope of this session, I think I will prototype at least the print, web and sound displays as well as the user response surveys to get a sense of where to start with the creation of the experiment. As part of my research I would like to conduct experiments on information retention when content is displayed on various platform and mediums. This will involve the creation of a usable prototype that a group of testers will use, and then the design of a survey or interview process to get the feedback on what information was most engagingly displayed and in what format. An interesting idea presented during today’s session was to use an already existing, established data visualization which I can reinterpret into different formats to test the communicability of various mediums.

            </p>
           
            <h3>CURRENT "what/why/how/so what"</h3>
<p>
            


1.	What<br>
A series of data visualizations employing an exploration of various mediums to express aspects of a dataset downloaded from one Facebook user account.
            </p>
            <p>
2.	Why<br>
The way that we receive and distribute content has changed vastly from the print culture that preceded. It’s important to be conscious and critical of these changes, and to consider the ways that medium and digital technology affect the perception of information. In addition, this thesis research is a dive into personal data and the extent to which information is collected on an individual person online. On one hand, to what extent does our online presence illustrate an accurate reflection of the real-life individual, and how has the advent of social media and digital technology affected the way that we interact with the world? On the other hand, how willing are viewers to breach the privacy of an individual to explore the possibilities of diving into personal information?             </p>
            <p>
3.	How<br>
This is intended to be a multi-media data visualization, using data sonification, interactive web visualizations, as well as printed mediums to express the story of one person’s online presence through their Facebook data. I plan to use D3, HTML, CSS and JS to create the interactive web portions; P5.js or flocking.js for the sonifications; Adobe Illustrator for poster design and Adobe InDesign for any accompanying pamphlets.
            </p>
            
    
<p>
 4. So what?<br>
    With the rapid change to digital technology our means of data collection and information distribution has transformed the way that we function within the world. Because of this, it is important to be mindful and aware of the ways in which we share information and represent ourselves online. For example, there is a tendency to search for people on the internet even before meeting them in person, as a sort of digital screening for the real-world interaction to come. My thesis is interested in examining the effects of changes in medium: in the creation of the data visualizations through various means, as well as in the examination of changes in human interaction in the use of social media.

            <h3>1. Lev Manovich's 144 Hours in Kyiv</h3>
        
            

                  <!-- Preview Image -->
         <div><a href="http://www.the-everyday.net"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src='img/lev.jpg' width="560" height="50" ></a></div> 
                
                   <hr>
            <p>
         WHAT: Manovich’s project analyzes and visualizes Instagram posts from Ukraine during the moment of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution.
</p>

   
            
         <p> 
             WHY: This project explores the question: what can visual social media tell about the experiences of people during a social upheaval? It also investigates how exceptional events can coexist with everyday activities, and how the ordinary and extraordinary are connected visually. 
       
             
</p>

            <p>
            HOW: Using Instagram public API, Manovich and his team collected publicly available Instagram photos located from Kyiv during the span of the two months in February 2014 taht marked the Ukrainian revolution, Maidan. An analysis of these images was possible using open source and custom software tools to discover the upload dates and times, geolocations, and tags. 
</p>
            <p>SO WHAT: The importance of this project lies in the fact that it uses such an intimate and personal sharing of content to tell a story about a big event that news outlets and headlines would generalize. In this sense, there is more of a personal, real approach in this project. 
</p>

            
            
                        <h3>2. JeongHo Park’s Asteroid Sonification </h3>
 <div><a href="https://vimeo.com/131640439"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src='img/asteroid.jpg' width="560" height="50" ></a></div> 
          <hr>

      <p>
         WHAT: Essentially, JeongHo Park’s project is a data sonification of asteroids that is interactive through a digital interface that additionally visualizes the asteroids as well. Each asteroid sound is triggered when it enters into the playable zone. 
</p>

   
            
         <p> 
             WHY: This is a data sonification, which is an unorthodox but fascinating approach to understanding and interpreting information which is largely translated visually. 
       
             
</p>

            <p>
            HOW: Park draws on the Asteroid Database and Mining Rankings API for the data, and combines that with a spectrum sound generator to create the sound.

</p>
            <p>SO WHAT: His work is particularly meaningful because it shows the effectiveness of certain mediums over others when trying to present specific aspects of the data; in this case, Park’s asteroid sonification work is ideal for showing changes over time and recognizing patterns.
</p>
            
            
            
            
                        <h3>3. Mudit Ganguly's Phonopticon: The Age of Mobile Surveillance</h3>

          <hr>

      <p>
         WHAT: This thesis project for the Digital Futures Masters is a design research project analyzing and creating something dubbed the Phonopticon, an immersive installation informing the audience about privacy breaches in mobile applications.
</p>

   
            
         <p> 
             WHY: To spread awareness on the amount of information and data gathered by the applications on our smartphones. 
       
             
</p>

            <p>
            HOW: The thesis research uses Ken Wilber’s All Quadrant All Level as a guiding theoretical framework. Additionally, a study of six participants investigated how people use and understand the privacy concerns in the applications on their phones. Finally, the thesis project includes research through design and Barry Boehm’s Spiral Model of Software Development to create a physical installation that serves as a data visualization that informs users about the extent of privacy breaches on their phones. 

</p>
            <p>SO WHAT: Tt’s important to reevaluate the function and presence of smartphones in our individual lives, as they may be collecting more personal information than people are aware of.
