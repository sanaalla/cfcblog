            <h3>Notes from final critique</h3>
            <ul>
<li>How people represent themselves online: using data visualization </li>
<li>For thesis: personal data from social media sites + Google </li>
<li>Showcased the components: the data based on social media outlet being shown </li>
<li>Tuesday Feedback: </li><ul>
<li> Deeper analysis needed / more content </li>
<li>More meaningful in a cross platform investigation </li>
<li>These platforms why? </li>
<li>Think about the way you use these social media outlets // led Sana into the UX design for participation from users // Considering this more throughout the process </li>
<li>Common lens / like when this data was collected / for a more common narrative between subjects </li></ul>
<li>Thinking about the affect / the purpose and influence it can have on a given topic</li>
<li>Done two demos for the ideation process  - you have done this from Emma </li>
<li>How can data be constructive with these different ‘identities’? Response: The communication value</li>
<li>Useful to communicate the self-realization / like your biases – Natalie. Response: Doing workshops for this </li>
<li>For FB see what other people have posted? YES // to some degree based on how friends are ranked… with information being posted. Comparison with other interactions versus your own posting</li>
<li>Data Science methodologies? How will you process and compare the data? Response: Reading a book on data visualization – and going more into the methods. Rigour around how you parsed the data / as much science and art / the visualization is the ‘easy’ part. The categories and ontology the rules and convention will make this more useful. – Anna </li>
                </ul>


<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>
    
In conducting the user testing, I found that many people were interested in going in different types of navigation paths than I had anticipated. Also, many testers commented on the choice of platforms that I used in the prototype and questioned the different uses of each. For example, Google was mentioned as a very different mode of individual representation vs. social media. This led me into the idea of: how does the platform get people to contribute data? How does the User Experience design of a web platform affect the way people use it, and therefore affects the construction of persona online?</p>
<p>
There was also a discussion of incorporating a ‘common lens’ for visualizing the data from these diverse platforms; how does time or time of day affect the data that is being shared/collected; how does time change identity, and the way that it tranforms identity across a 10 year period?
            </p>
            <p>
I definitely found the prototyping process incredibly helpful to get me started in thinking about my research process in a creative, physical way. I started out with quite a different thesis interest (looking at the ways in which meaning can be communicated through different mediums and in what ways the medium affects the digestion of the content) which through the course of this class has morphed into something that has elements of the original interest (mostly concerning communication of meaning), but now with a very direct focus on self-produced data that is retrieved from social media sites. My thesis has become much more interested in looking at the ways we form identity online and the extent to which we can communicate our own self through the internet, and consequentially, through data. There also has been a consistent interest in data visualization and while originally I was looking at "visualizing" data through sound, touch, etc., through the process of prototyping I found myself not as intrigued and/or qualified to create a scientific experimentation process that would truly answer my original research questions. I am much more focused now and happier with the way that my thesis is developing, and am looking at the possibility of creating a data visualization tool using my own personal data collected online to build a narrative of the construction of identity through internet data, as well as keeping in mind the bias and the priorities of these individual sites that may affect the way that that data is stored.
 </p>
      
<br>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
            <p>The conversations sparked from the prototyping process and the user testing have made me solidify the idea that I need to flesh out the content, as well as to incorporate a more direct lens to analyze the data and the way that this work fits into the context of internet identity. I also need to keep in mind the internet's influence not only on our own interpersonal relationships and sense of self, but also on the way that our society functions on a macro level. 
</p>
<p>
    A very notable piece of feedback from the final critique was Anna's note concerning actually looking at data visualization methods and being careful about contextualizing my practice of creating data viz in the realm of studies that show what methods may  work over others. I think it was definitely something good for me to keep in mind. 
 </p>
            <p>
My next steps will definitely include getting more fluent in D3, which is the tool I am planning to use to create these visualizations, and designing what my research outline will ultimately look like; how I might design participatory workshops where other people's personal online data can be visualized and then conducting post-workshop interviews; continuing my readings that will help to formulate my thesis writing and ground my research and practice.

                           <h3>User testing</h3>
<p>
            


In-session observations:<br>
It seemed that people were pretty clear on how to navigate through the site in the basic path I had laid out, but there was some confusion regarding what was actually interactive in the prototype and what wasn’t (which is to be expected.) Users were actually most likely to be interested in a different combination of buttons than I had anticipated; for example, Emma Brito as well as Feng both were inclined to click on Google first out of the circles laid out on the home screen (I hypothesize that this is because that is the largest circle shown as well as being first in the order.) All in all, it seemed fairly straightforward; it seemed that the few aspects of the Facebook comments that I had visualized were digestible and understandable—however, It definitely seemed like people were looking for more information or perhaps a deeper meaning from the prototype.

            </p>
            <p>
In-session discussion: Emma<br>
Emma tries to click Google first, then re-navigates to Facebook, wherein she attempts to click on Friends; re-navigates to Comments, following my instructions. 
She finds it interesting that Google is included on the same level as the rest of the social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) and is interested in the idea of how comparing Google vs. social media can create a portraiture of a person. Prof. Emma also comes by during this session and mentions the relevance of the Hello Avatar text by Beth Coleman to this research.             </p>
            <p>
In-session discussion: Feng<br>
Feng agrees with Emma’s comment regarding the disparity between Google’s and social media’s function, and notes that people will tend to present themselves differently based off of the digital platform which they find themselves on; she uses the example of Instagram, which she believes she uses in a way that exemplifies her outward appearance, whereas Twitter is used more professionally or creatively. Within the prototype, she finds the idea of Facebook tags most interesting to investigate, because although everything we post online is curated, the tags from other people may show something different than what is projected by an individual. 
Feng also is interested in the role of time and location in helping to develop a narrative within the data. During this discussion, I note that the timestamp of the Facebook data needs to be converted from Unix time to a more usable format. There is an ensuing conversation regarding the possibility of having each individual user upload their own datasets to the future website to have their own personal data visualized; however, I mention that it took several hours for me to download my own datasets, so this may not be a very user friendly route to take for the purpose of a demonstration. 
Feng asks why these particular social media platforms? -answer: because these are the platforms that I am personally most active on and therefore the sites which have collected the most data. 
Also mentions that an interesting exploration might be to fabricate an entirely constructed online presence and then to visualize that data.

            </p>
             <p>
In-session discussion: Sean<br>
Sean mentions that an interesting angle might be to consider the way that neural networks learn, and suggests feeding personal data to an AI and allowing the AI to reconstruct the data in a way that could be representative of the way the AI sees me, based on the data. Mentions that the use of personal data makes this a very auto-ethnographic research project. I discuss the possibility of doing workshops and visualizing other people’s data, and Sean responds that depending on what waivers etc. are approved, this data could then be used in a larger visualization comparing data trends across this study group. 


            </p>
                        <p>
In-session discussion: Tommy<br>
Mentions that my project is similar to Mudit’s, which Tommy hints is lacking because it educates the user that data is being collected on them but then doesn’t necessarily go further than that. Says that the workshop sessions would be interesting and especially if interviews with participants are conducted afterwords to record their reactions to the data. Tommy relates a concept from his own reading of Queer Phenomenology and notes the distance between people when using social media; the proximity is to a phone or a computer, not to a person, and therefore a divide and separation happens. Tommy also mentions that he personally doesn’t think that he varies that much from the person that he projects online and the person that he actually is in real life; the only difference is the filtering of himself that he engages with when posting online. He says that he chooses to not display certain aspects to show online, the more intimate moments that he might share with people in real life.

            </p>
                     <p>
In-session discussion: Prof. Kate and Prof. Emma<br>
They mention the durational aspect, and question how time can change identity.
What’s the common lens? Can stage of life be a common lens? (time of day could be a common lens)
How do things (people) change over time? What’s the difference in the way that we represent ourselves online across a 10 year period? What is the Axes of navigation?
Mention that right now the prototype feels neutral, and they wonder what happens next. How can the prototype get the user to a deeper level of engagement? Suggest a cross platform analysis which display what parts of a person are shown in which platform. 
They are also intrigued by the idea of visibility online, and particularly what is visible vs. invisible. Emma mentions that the things important to her are not necessarily important to Google, and may get lost. How does memory work over time? Mentions the idea of foreground and background, and choosing what to share vs what the systems are actively tracking. 

            </p>
            
            
             <p>
Revision ideas:<br>
The most obvious course of action seems to be to flesh out the rest of the content in order to get a better sense of the architecture of the site. It was also quite clear that there needs to be a more detailed and perhaps more comprehensive and complex data visualization created to represent the data. I'm thinking of exploring the possibity of creating a 3D data visualization in the website. I am also thinking about the design of these workshop sessions as I feel that may be very informative and useful to my research process.

            <p>
I think that my research interest has definitely evolved and become more focused due to the intense prototyping and making process that we went through in the first week of this prototyping course. Having to make an initial prototype challenged me in thinking less about the conceptual, writing-focused aspects of the thesis to actually considering how I would test the research questions I had formulated early on. In the beginning, I was interested in conducting scientific experiments on the retention of information depending on the form of medium in which participants had been presented the information in. However, when iterating the first version of what that experiment could look like, I found that I was less interested in the rigorous methodological framework this type of project would require and wanted to take a more focused approach to this thesis. 
</p>

   <p>by the way, here is the link to the user testing video compilation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSiOIob6bCo" target="_blank">VIDEO</a></p>

            <p>
Equally, the feedback I got from many of my peers (in post-it exercises and in-person conversation) was the need to figure out the message in question (if indeed my thesis is centered somewhat around medium is the message). This really made me think of the content itself, and exactly what I am visualizing. Keeping within the initial thought of using multiple mediums to convey aspects of the same dataset, or message, Feng (during our group session at one of the intensive CFC days) suggested to look at what personal data I can use. She specifically suggested looking at my own genetic data; however, after looking into this option I realized that genetics is still a new field and accessing your own genetic data is not actually as straightforward as I had hoped. Nevertheless, I was still intrigued by the idea of representation of a person through data, and then realized that it might make sense to use the data I’ve created on my own, digitally, throughout the years. Facebook turned out to have a vast amount of data collected on me (4 gigs worth=10 years of data collection!) that I was able to download as a bunch of folders of JSON. Honestly, this is looking like the most viable option for me to begin prototyping some visualizations/data representations of.

      <p>
It really helps, I think, to have a clearer sense of the actual information I’m going to use, as it becomes a lot more digestible in my mind and also makes it feel more related to the design research methodology that I was hoping to use in this process. I met with Adam Tindale just to talk over the development of my thesis ideas and he brought up a really good point on WHY the development of the actual prototype/design product is important to the core of the thesis; why is this an MDes, vs. an MA? and I think that’s a really good question and something that would be worth keeping in mind for me.

<p>
            


1.	What<br>
My thesis interest lies in exploring the question: what becomes of meaning when it is displayed in different mediums? Is information interpreted equally across all platforms? This research is situated in the context of ideas expressed by Marshall McLuhan and Neil Postman, and includes a process of creation and experimentation. Additionally, in my research I would like to address the significance of personal identity and bias and the influence they have on the interpretation of information. I’d like to explore how content transforms, is limited by, or expanded within the form of media it is presented by.

            </p>

2.	Why<br>
With the rapid development and change to digital technology, the way that we receive and distribute content changes vastly from the print culture that preceded; and before print, the change was from an oral culture. I think that it is important to be conscious and critical of these changes, and to consider the ways that mediums in addition to print and web also may affect the perception of information. Because there is a hypothesis that the message is absorbed differently across different mediums, it suggests that depending on the mode that people are receiving their information, it may develop into varying levels of understanding. This threatens to widen a gap of perception that already may exist, since people are already receiving and understanding content differently based on their own personal bias, in addition to the way in which that content had been accessed.

            <p>
3.	How<br>
I hope to prototype the experimental phase of my research for user testing. This would involve the reformatting of an existing data visualization into other mediums, such as web, mobile, sound and possibly haptics; therefore, for the scope of this session, I think I will prototype at least the print, web and sound displays as well as the user response surveys to get a sense of where to start with the creation of the experiment. As part of my research I would like to conduct experiments on information retention when content is displayed on various platform and mediums. This will involve the creation of a usable prototype that a group of testers will use, and then the design of a survey or interview process to get the feedback on what information was most engagingly displayed and in what format. An interesting idea presented during today’s session was to use an already existing, established data visualization which I can reinterpret into different formats to test the communicability of various mediums.

            <h3>CURRENT "what/why/how/so what"</h3>
<p>
            


1.	What<br>
A series of data visualizations employing an exploration of various mediums to express aspects of a dataset downloaded from one Facebook user account.
            </p>
            <p>
2.	Why<br>
The way that we receive and distribute content has changed vastly from the print culture that preceded. It’s important to be conscious and critical of these changes, and to consider the ways that medium and digital technology affect the perception of information. In addition, this thesis research is a dive into personal data and the extent to which information is collected on an individual person online. On one hand, to what extent does our online presence illustrate an accurate reflection of the real-life individual, and how has the advent of social media and digital technology affected the way that we interact with the world? On the other hand, how willing are viewers to breach the privacy of an individual to explore the possibilities of diving into personal information?             </p>
            <p>
3.	How<br>
This is intended to be a multi-media data visualization, using data sonification, interactive web visualizations, as well as printed mediums to express the story of one person’s online presence through their Facebook data. I plan to use D3, HTML, CSS and JS to create the interactive web portions; P5.js or flocking.js for the sonifications; Adobe Illustrator for poster design and Adobe InDesign for any accompanying pamphlets.

 4. So what?<br>
    With the rapid change to digital technology our means of data collection and information distribution has transformed the way that we function within the world. Because of this, it is important to be mindful and aware of the ways in which we share information and represent ourselves online. For example, there is a tendency to search for people on the internet even before meeting them in person, as a sort of digital screening for the real-world interaction to come. My thesis is interested in examining the effects of changes in medium: in the creation of the data visualizations through various means, as well as in the examination of changes in human interaction in the use of social media.

            <h3>1. Lev Manovich's 144 Hours in Kyiv</h3>
        
            

                  <!-- Preview Image -->
         <div><a href="http://www.the-everyday.net" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src='img/lev.jpg' width="560" height="50" ></a></div> 
                
                   <hr>
            <p>
         WHAT: Manovich’s project analyzes and visualizes Instagram posts from Ukraine during the moment of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution.
</p>

   
            
         <p> 
             WHY: This project explores the question: what can visual social media tell about the experiences of people during a social upheaval? It also investigates how exceptional events can coexist with everyday activities, and how the ordinary and extraordinary are connected visually. 
       
             
</p>

            <p>
            HOW: Using Instagram public API, Manovich and his team collected publicly available Instagram photos located from Kyiv during the span of the two months in February 2014 taht marked the Ukrainian revolution, Maidan. An analysis of these images was possible using open source and custom software tools to discover the upload dates and times, geolocations, and tags. 
</p>
            <p>SO WHAT: The importance of this project lies in the fact that it uses such an intimate and personal sharing of content to tell a story about a big event that news outlets and headlines would generalize. In this sense, there is more of a personal, real approach in this project. 
</p>

            
            
                        <h3>2. JeongHo Park’s Asteroid Sonification </h3>
 <div><a href="https://vimeo.com/131640439" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src='img/asteroid.jpg' width="560" height="50" ></a></div> 
          <hr>

      <p>
         WHAT: Essentially, JeongHo Park’s project is a data sonification of asteroids that is interactive through a digital interface that additionally visualizes the asteroids as well. Each asteroid sound is triggered when it enters into the playable zone. 
</p>

   
            
         <p> 
             WHY: This is a data sonification, which is an unorthodox but fascinating approach to understanding and interpreting information which is largely translated visually. 
       
             
</p>

            <p>
            HOW: Park draws on the Asteroid Database and Mining Rankings API for the data, and combines that with a spectrum sound generator to create the sound.

</p>
            <p>SO WHAT: His work is particularly meaningful because it shows the effectiveness of certain mediums over others when trying to present specific aspects of the data; in this case, Park’s asteroid sonification work is ideal for showing changes over time and recognizing patterns.
</p>
            
            
            
            
                        <h3>3. Mudit Ganguly's Phonopticon: The Age of Mobile Surveillance</h3>

          <hr>

      <p>
         WHAT: This thesis project for the Digital Futures Masters is a design research project analyzing and creating something dubbed the Phonopticon, an immersive installation informing the audience about privacy breaches in mobile applications.
</p>

   
            
         <p> 
             WHY: To spread awareness on the amount of information and data gathered by the applications on our smartphones. 
       
             
</p>

            <p>
            HOW: The thesis research uses Ken Wilber’s All Quadrant All Level as a guiding theoretical framework. Additionally, a study of six participants investigated how people use and understand the privacy concerns in the applications on their phones. Finally, the thesis project includes research through design and Barry Boehm’s Spiral Model of Software Development to create a physical installation that serves as a data visualization that informs users about the extent of privacy breaches on their phones. 

</p>
            <p>SO WHAT: Tt’s important to reevaluate the function and presence of smartphones in our individual lives, as they may be collecting more personal information than people are aware of.
